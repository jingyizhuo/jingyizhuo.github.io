If you are interested in learning more about my research and working with me, please send me an email at [jonathanlin@cornell.edu](mailto:jonathanlin@cornell.edu).

### Postdoctoral Researchers
While I do not have any postdoctoral positions actively open, anyone interested in working with me as a postdoc should get in contact with me via email -- the earlier the better. Please see [here](https://linjonathan.github.io/pdfs/Resources_for_Postdocs.pdf) for general advice around postdocs. If you choose to apply for a fellowship and get your proposal funded, you will have the freedom to pursue your own ideas. Please see [here](https://linjonathan.github.io/pdfs/Resources_for_Postdocs.pdf) for a list of fellowships that may be appropriate.

### Graduate Students
Students apply to the [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.eas.cornell.edu/eas/programs/graduate-programs) graduate program at Cornell. The deadline for Fall 2025 admission is January 1st, 2024. If the application fee represents a financial hardship, you may apply for a [fee waiver](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/admissions/apply/application-fees/). Students who are accepted to the program receive a stipend. See [here](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/stipend-rates/) for more details. Funding is typically a mixture of research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and fellowships.

### Undergraduate Students
I am generally happy to advise any undergraduate students interested in doing research in tropical meteorology -- either during the academic year (and for a thesis) or over the summer. There is a possibility of doing research for course credit, a thesis project, or as a summer internship. In general, it is good to have some background in math, physics, and coding. Please reach out to me via email to discuss if working with me would be fruitful for your career.
