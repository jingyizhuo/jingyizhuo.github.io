About Me
======
I am a first-year graduate student in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT, where I am being advised by Prof. Kerry Emanuel. I attended Princeton University for my undergraduate degree, where I majored in computer science. 

My research interests are in hurricane prediction and predictability.

I also enjoy playing volleyball and basketball, listening to music, and cooking.
