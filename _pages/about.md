I am currently an Assistant Professor at Cornell University's Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department. Previously, I graduated with my Ph.D. in atmospheric science from the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT, under the supervision of Prof. Kerry Emanuel. I attended Princeton University for my undergraduate degree, where I majored in computer science and obtained a certificate in Geological Engineering.
