I am currently a postdoctoral scientist in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at MIT, where I graduated with my Ph.D. in atmospheric science under the supervision of Prof. Kerry Emanuel. I attended Princeton University for my undergraduate degree, where I majored in computer science and obtained a certificate in Geological Engineering. 

My current research interests are in tropical cyclone prediction/predictability, and dynamics of equatorial waves.

I also enjoy playing volleyball and basketball, listening to music, and cooking.
