I am currently an Postdoc research scientist at Princetion University's Department of Geosciences, working with Knox Taylor Professor of Geosciences Gabriel Vecchi. I received both my Ph.D. and B.S in atmospheric science from Nanjing University in China, under the supervision of Prof. Zhe-Min Tan. I use a combination of physics-based theoretical frameworks, climate modeling, and machine learning techniques for better understanding of climate variability and climate change on broad timescales, as well as enhance prediction of tropical cyclone variability on time scales spanning weather and climate.

For real-time, deep learning based tropical cyclone intensity and size monitoring, see [tcai]([http://tcs.mit.edu](https://forecast.nju.edu.cn/deeptcnet)).
