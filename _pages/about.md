I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in the Department of Geosciences at **Princeton University**, working with **Gabriel Vecchi**, the Knox Taylor Professor of Geosciences. I received both my Ph.D. and B.S. degrees in Atmospheric Science from **Nanjing University**, under the supervision of **Professor Zhe-Min Tan**.

My research use physics-based theory, climate modeling, and machine learning to enhance understanding of climate variability and change across a range of timescales. A particular focus of my work is enhancing the prediction and understanding of tropical cyclone variability, spanning from weather to climate scales.
